                        Welcome to <strong>Sea Eats</strong>, where the ocean meets your plate. Our journey began in 2010, when our founder, <strong>Sean Jenkins</strong>, a lifelong seafood enthusiast, decided to bring the flavors of the sea to the heart of the city. Growing up in a small coastal town, Marco developed a deep appreciation for fresh, sustainably sourced seafood. His dream was to create a restaurant that not only served delicious dishes but also celebrated the beauty and bounty of the ocean.

                        At Sea Eats, we believe in the power of simplicity. Our menu is a tribute to the freshest ingredients, prepared with care and respect for tradition. From our signature <strong>Grilled Lobster Tail</strong> to the rich and comforting <strong>New England Clam Chowder</strong>, every dish tells a story of passion and dedication.
